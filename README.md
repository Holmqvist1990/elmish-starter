# Elmish Getting Started

Modified version of [elmish-getting-started](https://github.com/Zaid-Ajaj/elmish-getting-started).

## Building and running the app

First of all, start with installing the project's npm dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
Once this is finished, you can then build and compile the project:
```
npm run build
```
You can start developing the application in watch mode using the webpack development server:
```
npm start
```
After the first compilation is finished, navigate to http://localhost:8080 in your browser to see the application.
